          <p>Andriy Mykolayovych Shevchenko</p>
          <p>Ukrainian politician, football manager and former professional footballer</p>
          <p>Played for Dynamo Kyiv, Milan, Chelsea and the Ukraine national team</p>
          <p>Shevchenko was appointed Ukraine's head coach.</p>
          <p>Shevchenko is ranked as the fifth top goalscorer in all European competitions with 67 goals.</p>
          <p>With a tally of 176 goals scored for Milan</p>
          <p>Top scorer for the Ukrainian national team with 48 goals.</p>
          <p> Ballon d'Or in 2004 (becoming the third Ukrainian, after Oleh Blokhin and Igor Belanov, to receive it).</p>
          <p>He won the UEFA Champions League in 2003 with Milan</p>
          <p> He was also an UEFA Champions League runner-up in 2005 and 2008. </p>
          <p>He was named in the FIFA World XI for 2005.</p>
          <p>A fast, hardworking, energetic, and well-rounded striker, Shevchenko was a prolific and highly opportunistic goalscorer, who was usually deployed as an out-and-out striker in a centre-forward role, although he was capable of operating anywhere along the front line,and often played in a free role, in which he could attack from the left wing, and get past opposing defenders with his runs into the penalty area, courtesy of his pace and movement off the ball. He also occupied a wider position as an outright winger on the left flank at times, in particular at the beginning of his career, and also during his second stint with Dynamo Kyiv during his later years he was also capable of playing on the right. Shevchenko was also effective from set-pieces, and was an accurate penalty taker.A strong and physical striker with an eye for goal, he was primarily known for his excellent positional sense, movement off the ball, and finishing ability inside the box, as well as his composure in front of goal moreover, he possessed a powerful and accurate shot with either foot, from both inside and outside the area. Although he was not known to take part in aerial duels frequently, he was also good in the air, due to his heading ability. Often compared by pundits to fellow former Milan striker Marco van Basten, although he was not as elegant as the Dutch forward, he also possessed good technique; furthermore, despite mainly being a goalscorer, he was capable of playing off of his teammates, in addition to scoring goals himself, due to his link-up play.</p>
